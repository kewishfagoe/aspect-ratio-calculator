# Aspect Ratio Calculator

I often find myself resizing images but need to keep the new image at the same aspect ratio of the original.
I tend to usually only have the width or the height of what the resized image should be.
This is a small aspect ratio calculator experiment to calculate the missing width or height sticking to the 
aspect ratio of the original image. This project serves me for that particular use case.
